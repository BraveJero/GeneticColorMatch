# Genetic Algorithm for Color Mixing

This project is a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm that determines the combination of colors needed to create a specific color. The input is the RGB values of the desired color, and the output is the combination of colors needed to create it.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the `genetic_color_mixing.py` script using Python 3.6 or higher.
4. Enter the RGB values of the desired color when prompted.

## How it Works

The program generates a population of potential solutions that are combinations of colors in varying proportions. The fitness of each solution is determined by how close its resulting color is to the desired color. The genetic algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Initialize a population of potential solutions.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each solution.
3. Select the fittest solutions to reproduce.
4. Generate offspring through crossover and mutation.
5. Evaluate the fitness of the offspring.
6. Select the fittest offspring to form the next generation.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until a satisfactory solution is found or a maximum number of generations is reached.

The program uses NumPy to generate random numbers and Matplotlib to visualize the fitness of each generation.

## Limitations

This implementation has several limitations:

- It assumes that the colors are a combination of red, green, and blue channels.
- It only considers combinations of colors, whereas other factors such as brightness and saturation can also affect the resulting color.
- It may converge to a suboptimal solution if the population size or number of generations is too small.
